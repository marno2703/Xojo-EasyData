Xojo EasyData for FileMaker Developers - Making Xojo Database Apps Easier

I come from a background in FileMaker development and I'm also a Xojo developer. I love both platforms but I find that it takes me longer to work with databases in Xojo than it does with FileMaker. This project intends to reduce the time it takes to work with databases in Xojo.

This Desktop app read from a sqlite database file, shows contacts in a window, and shows the details when a contact is clicked.

Xojo is free to use for an unlimited amount of time. You only need to purchase it to build your apps, but you can run and debug them without paying. If you are using the Xojo Demo, you'll be required to save the project as a binary project as saving to the text version can only be done with the non-demo version of Xojo.
