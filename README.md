Xojo EasyData for FileMaker Developers - Making Xojo Database Apps Easier

I come from a background in FileMaker development and I'm also a Xojo developer. I love both platforms but I find that it takes me longer to work with databases in Xojo than it does with FileMaker. This project intends to reduce the time it takes to work with databases in Xojo.

Xojo is free to use for an unlimited amount of time. You only need to purchase it to build your apps, but you can run and debug them without paying. The Xojo demo can open the 'Xojo EasyData.xojo_binary_project' and the non demo version can open the 'Xojo EasyData.xojo_project' which is saved as text files, perfect for git. 

# Getting Started
- Download Xojo from http://xojo.com/
- Download this project.
- Open either the 'Xojo EasyData.xojo_binary_project' or 'Xojo EasyData.xojo_project' file.
